## Filter
Filter is a C program that I wrote to manipulate images(filter images). It does exactly what the name implies. The Filter program has four filters;

1. Grayscale filter: This filter turns the image into black and white.
2. Sepia filter; which gives images an old-timey feel by making the whole image look a bit reddish-brown.
3. Reflection filter; Some filters might also move pixels around. Reflecting an image, for example.
4. Blur; There are a number of ways to create the effect of blurring or softening an image. For this problem, we’ll use the “box blur,” which works by taking each pixel and, for each color value, giving it a new value by averaging the color values of neighboring pixels.
